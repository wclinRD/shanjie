/*
 * shanjie core C ABI (docs/contracts/s3a.md §6). Implemented in core/src/ffi.rs; link libcore.a.
 *
 * Notes for the Swift shell (S3b):
 *  - Output contents are user input. Never pass them to NSLog, print, debugPrint, dump, os_log or any
 *    other logging; never interpolate input text into fatalError / precondition / assert messages.
 *  - Copy every field you need into Swift `String`s in the same call that received the output, then
 *    call shanjie_output_free immediately. Do not keep ShanjieOutput pointers around.
 *  - A handle is not thread-safe: make every call on one thread (the IMK main thread).
 *  - Any non-zero return: treat the key as not handled (pass it through) and do not record it.
 *
 * Return codes: 0 success, 1 a required pointer is NULL, 2 invalid input (data_dir or LM path not
 * UTF-8, ch not a Unicode scalar, kind / layout / mode / profile out of range), 3 data load failed
 * (including an unreadable or malformed LM file), 4 internal error (caught panic or decode/encode
 * error; the engine has already been reset in discard mode). shanjie_engine_load_lm failing leaves the
 * LM state as it was (no LM, or the previously loaded one).
 *
 * Memory and lifetime:
 *  - On a non-zero return, *out is set to NULL (when out itself is non-NULL) and nothing is allocated.
 *  - shanjie_engine_free(NULL) and shanjie_output_free(NULL) do nothing. Freeing twice, or freeing a
 *    pointer this library did not return, is undefined behaviour.
 *  - A ShanjieOutput owns copies of all its strings and of the candidates array; they stay valid
 *    until shanjie_output_free, regardless of later engine_key / engine_reset / engine_set_profile /
 *    engine_load_lm / engine_free calls.
 *
 * Language model (S2c):
 *  - The default profile is chat. The shell picks the profile from the frontmost app (S3b); the core
 *    keeps no app identity. A profile set before any LM is loaded is remembered and applies once loaded.
 *  - Load the LM once at startup while the composition is empty: loading does not recompute the
 *    current display; the next change to the composition decodes with the new model.
 *  - shanjie_engine_reset (both modes) and the automatic reset after code 4 clear the composition only;
 *    the loaded LM and the current profile are kept.
 *  - The logging rules above apply to set_profile snapshots too; never log the LM path either.
